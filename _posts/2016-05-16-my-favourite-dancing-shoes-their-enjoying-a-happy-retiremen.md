# Charity Dance

Half the people who have ever met me probably remember me for dancing rather than anything else. But I've always been hugely embarassed by this, and normally need a little Dutch courage before so much as taping a toe.

I also hate cameras at these times, which is odd as I normally don't mind making a fool of myself.

So its with fear I'd like to commit myself to doing a music video of sorts, in the name of a good charitable cause. I'll put together the video this year and I plan to run round Zurich lake too which is 2.5 marathons long. 

I've never run a marathon, but its safe to say I'm more scared by the dancing.
