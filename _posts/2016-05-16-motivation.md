# Motivation

I remember thinking, when I was a kid, that 2012 would be a busy year for science, for London and for me. I had it in my mind that it wouldn't be until I was 28 that my life was in order, and I'd find out what being an adult meant.

Of course, so many people don't make it that far, or have the luxury of planning ahead for themselves or their loved ones. With a short time between them, my father had a heart attack, and my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I'm so lucky to have them both with me still, to have them both as a guiding force in my life, and to have them here to be loving in hard times and the best of times.

I think it is important in those heady high points of life, or stressful times where we push the rest of the world to the back of our mind, to try and keep some perspective. Perspective on the wider world, but also to perceive and enjoy small pleasures in the moment to moment. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5b0570f9-d78c-499e-accc-02903f5476a9.jpg)

So here are a few things collected together to celebrate health and happiness, and to give something to those in need both today and in the future.
